                        <p>The Linux <a href="gloss01.html#gloss01entry264"><em>kernel</em></a> was developed by Finnish <br>undergraduate student Linus Torvalds, who used the Internet to make the source <br>code immediately available to others for free.
                            Torvalds released Linux version <br>0.01 in September 1991.<br>The new operating system came together through a lot of hard <br>work. Programmers around the world were quick to extend the kernel and develop <br>other tools,
                            adding functionality to match that already found in both BSD UNIX <br>and System V UNIX (SVR4) as well as new functionality.<br>The Linux operating system, developed through the cooperation <br>of many, many people around the
                            world, is a product of <br>the Internet and is a free operating <br>system. In other words, all the source code is free. You are free to study it, <br>redistribute it, and modify it. As a result, the code is available free
                            of <br>costâ€”no charge for the software, source, documentation, or support (via <br>newsgroups, mailing lists, and other Internet resources). As the GNU Free <br>Software Definition (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>)
                            puts it:</p>
                        <p>One way or another you are sitting in front of a screen that is <br>connected to a computer that is running Linux. You may be working with a <br>graphical user interface (GUI) or a textual interface. This book is about the <br>textual,
                            or command line, interface to Linux. If you are working with a GUI, you <br>will need to use a terminal emulator such as xterm, Konsole, or GNOME <br>Terminal, to follow along with the examples in this book.<br>This chapter
                            starts with a discussion of the typographical <br>conventions used in this book, followed by a section on <a href="ch02lev1sec2.html#ch02lev1sec2">logging in</a> on the system. Next there <br>is a brief reminder about the powers
                            of Superuser (root) and how to avoid making mistakes that will make <br>your system inoperable or hard to work with. The chapter continues with a <br>discussion about where to find more information about Linux. It concludes
                            with <br>additional information on logging in, including how to change your password.<br>While heeding the warning about the dangers of misusing the <br>powers of Superuser, feel free to experiment with your <br>system: Give
                            commands, create files, follow the examples in this book, and have <br>fun.</p>
